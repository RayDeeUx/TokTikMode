# <c-25f4ee>Tok</c><c-fe2c55>Tik</c>Mode

Play <co>Geometry</c> <cj>Dash</c> levels as if you were viewing a TokTik video. Or if you just want to play <co>Geometry</c> <cj>Dash</c> vertically for whatever reason.

<cy>***_Note:_*** Due to technical limitations, this mod is intentionally disabled when playing levels that use Rotate/Scale triggers, including Area Rotate/Scale triggers and Keyframe triggers.</c>

<cr>*While you can enable this mod on levels that use such triggers, doing so will very likely break a level's gameplay.*</c>

For <c-cdcdcd>macOS</c> and <c-00adef>Windows</c> folks, <c-25f4ee>Tok</c><c-fe2c55>Tik</c>Mode is best experienced on <cl>Borderless Fullscreen</c>. For <cg>Android</c> folks, well... you already *are* on Fullscreen, obviously.

<c-25f4ee>Tok</c><c-fe2c55>Tik</c>Mode was tested on the following devices, operating systems, and aspect ratios:
- <c-cdcdcd>MacBook Pro</c> (16-inch, 2019) running <c-cdcdcd>macOS</c> <c-2e88d6>Seq</c><c-f7a865>uoia</c> <c-cdcdcd>(macOS 15.0.1)</c> with a <cl>16:10</c> aspect ratio display
- <c-f50414>OnePlus 9 5G</c> (6.55-inch, 2021) running <c-0982ea>OxygenOS 13</c> (forked from <cg>Android 13</c>) with a <cl>20:9</c> aspect ratio display
- <c-007cb8>Dell Latitude 5420</c> (14-inch, 2021) running <c-00adef>Windows 10 Enterprise Build 19045</c> with a <cl>16:9</c> aspect ratio display

However, not all devices are created the same. Therefore, <c-25f4ee>Tok</c><c-fe2c55>Tik</c>Mode has additional settings for you to adjust positions and scaling of <c-25f4ee>Tok</c><c-fe2c55>Tik</c> UI elements to fit your device as necessary.
